QtTimer is a small project that I felt the need to write. The idea is
that the user can specify a time duration and they will be informed
after the time passes. The main use for me is to partition my work
time in small, usually 45 minute, intervals. Of course this can be
done easily using a shell script like this:

sleep $1m $2s
playsound --volume 10 ~/data/sounds/notify.ogg

The problem with the above script is that when I use it I often need
to see how much time remains. Another feature I would like to have is
the ability to pause the timer, although someone could argue that this
defeats the purpose of the project.

This is just a toy project. There are plenty of other timers, but I
wanted to create a non trivial example project, in order to test
github.

Enjoy!!

Software you need in order to compile QtTimer:

- cmake version at least 2.8.0

- Qt4. I have compiled it with 4.6.3, but I think earlier version
  would be OK as well.
